## Financialytics - API

### Overview

Money is essential to our everyday lives, and accurately managing one's money is equally vital. Many people, especially college students and young newlyweds, have not learned how to manage their finances or make a budget responsibly. They lack the knowledge and experience to plan or discuss finances in a meaningful way.

Financialytics is a QuickBooks-inspired program for personal use. It's designed to help college-age students and young newlyweds keep better track of their finances through an easy-to-use web application, enabling them to have the conversations they need to better manage their money. It is designed to help them track their spending and income, and determine if their money is working for or against them.

### How To

Financialytics is still under heavy development, with many exciting features on the horizon, but it isn't quite ready for widespread use on the web. However, if you're technologically adept and have the right resources, you'll be able to run your own local instance of Financialytics with ease and be able to have quick and easy financial tracking in no time. Simply ensure that both the <a href="https://github.com/j-a-chase/financialytics-server">server</a> and this API are running on your local machine, and you'll be able to explore and use the application.

Financialytics currently allows you to categorize and track your transactions by adding, editing, or deleting them. It also allows you to customize your targets, allowing for the addition of financial goals, new categories, or changing the budget amounts for your categories. There's currently no support for separating transaction totals by month, but that feature is first on the list of many to be implemented as time allows.
